Phoenix LiveView is an amazing tool to build real-time applications with server
rendered HTML. When the state changes, LiveView takes care of re-rendering the changes
and pushing them to the browser.

For one of my recent projects, I needed to show a list of `<video>` elements on a page.
Initialising the video required a call to

```
videoManager.attachVideo(videoTrack, element)
```

This is easily achieved via `phx-hook`. I simply add the `videoTrack` as a data attribute
to the element,

```
<video id={video_id}
       data-video-track={video_track}
       phx-hook={PlayVideo}/>
```

and initialise in the callback.

```
// app.js
const videoManager = ...
let Hooks = {}
Hooks.PlayVideo = {
  mounted() {
    videoManager.attachVideo(this.el.getAttribute("data-video-track"), this.el)
  }
  updated() {
    videoManager.attachVideo(this.el.getAttribute("data-video-track"), this.el)
  }
}
let liveSocket = new LiveSocket("/live", Socket, {hooks: Hooks, ...})
```

Great! This should _initialise_ and _update_ the video whenever the track changes in the
LiveView. Except, the update doesn't work.

The problem is, every time the track changes, `videoManager` requires a brand new
video element. Re-attaching to an existing `<video>` doesn't work. Now LiveView,
being efficient, only updates the attribute of the existing element, not create a new one.

The solution I implemented, thanks to the advice from Ben Wilson on the Elixir slack,
was attaching the hook to the videoâ€™s parent DOM element, and recreating the video element
in the callback. So the new HTML is

```
<div id={video=id}
     data-video-track={video_track}
     phx-hook={PlayVideo}>
  <video ...>
</div>
```

And the app.js is now

```
const videoManager = ...
let Hooks = {}
Hooks.PlayVideo = {
  mounted() {
    const video = this.el.children[0]
    videoManager.attachVideo(this.el.getAttribute("data-video-track"), video)
  }

  updated() {
    const oldVideo = this.el.children[0]
    const newVideo = oldVideo.cloneNode(false)
    videoManager.attachVideo(this.el.getAttribute("data-video-track"), newVideo)
    this.el.replaceChild(newVideo, oldVideo)
  }
}
let liveSocket = new LiveSocket("/live", Socket, {hooks: Hooks, ...})
```

The important piece here is that we clone the old video to get the new video. It
ensures that LiveView recognises it and doesn't replace it.
